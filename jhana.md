# Zmavli Caimle's Jhana Coaching

{% marginnote "1" "For the month of October 2025 only, I have a 20% grand opening discount on all services. Additional discounts are also available for people 25 years old or younger, and people living in below average PPP per capita countries." %}

{% newthought 'The jhanas are altered mental states' %} that one can access with sustained collectedness, and which do not require any psychoactive substances to access.  The experiences range from rapture, joy, contentment, to tranquility.

Aside from feeling really good and interesting, engaging in jhana can improve sensory and emotional clarity, emotional processing (less rumination), and can reduce ['ugh fields'](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields) or learned aversions and cravings, improve energy and alleviate avoidant attachment. I have personally experienced all of these things in my jhana practice.

I coach people in how to access the jhanas with audio calls. It is not necessary to be a monastic or be very experienced in meditation to access the jhanas —   many of my clients report having experiences very similar to jhana in the past or in childhood without realizing. I was able to access first jhana in fewer than 10 hours of sitting on my own, without prior meditation experience.

My teaching style is based on several short meditation sits in a two hour session with feedback after each one to facilitate iterative improvement. I structure my teaching such that it is possible for you to continue a meditation practice independently, if you so choose.

Currently, I offer a 30 minute intro call for free. We can talk about whether my teaching or jhana meditation are a good fit for you. I do my calls over Discord or Signal. Book one here: [https://novacal.io/zmavli/intro-call](https://novacal.io/zmavli/intro-call)

You can also email me at zcaimle [a t] gmail [d o t] com, DM me on X/Twitter @zmavli, or on Discord at @zmavli. My service offerings are listed below.


# Testimonials
*"Before my virtual meditation coaching session, I'd achieved first jhana twice but wasn't able to replicate the experiences. During the session Zmavli identified the mental block preventing me from reliably accessing first jhana and introduced me to a form of meditation that I found more effective than the form that I was previously using. Months later, I can still reliably access first jhana using the techniques that Zmavli taught me.*

*The aspect of the session that I valued most was the tight feedback loop. Zmavli's questions about my experience effectively revealed which aspects of meditation I was struggling with in ways that I failed to recognize through self-reflection alone. In the process of questioning, Zmavli created a atmosphere of nonjudgemental inquiry in which I felt comfortable divulging information that I would have been reluctant to share with most coaches but provided a crucial boost to my meditation effectiveness. Apart from offering immediately actionable concrete advice based on my self-reports, Zmavli also introduced me to some meditation theory and anecdotes that, apart from being useful, were just plain fun to discuss.*

*I'd recommend Zmavli's coaching to anyone curious about jhanas and looking for instruction that feels less like "woo" and more like a pair programming session with a skilled engineer."*

Konstantine Sadov, machine learning researcher, [https://www.ksadov.com/](https://www.ksadov.com/)

*"receiving instruction from zmavli, i appreciated the practicality and clarity. i got significant results after only three instruction sessions, managing to end up for some minutes in a state of exhilarating buzzing sensation, that is intense psychologically in a buzzing, intense and somewhat energizing way. (plausibly jhana!). this experience was intriguing and pleasant in novel ways. i learned new meditation objects, and the instruction re-energized some of my curiosity towards meditation in general."*

xylix, programmer, [https://xylix.fi/about](https://xylix.fi/about)

*"well honestly i quite liked your teaching, it was straightforward and made me feel like jhana was this attainable thing given some methods and ideas instead of this far away mystical thing of eastern religion"*

Hans Ting, WhiteBox AI interpretability program graduate


# Service offerings

**Trial  |  one session (2 hours): USD 120**  {% marginnote "2" "For the month of October 2025 only, USD 96" %}  
I offer singular sessions if you want to find out how I teach, or if you have a very specific and small jhana-related goal in mind.

**Glimpse of jhana  |  five sessions (10 hours): USD 500**  {% marginnote "3" "For the month of October 2025 only, USD 400" %}  
My core offering is teaching you the basics of jhana meditation and helping you access first or second jhana for at least a few seconds. The vast majority of my clients are able to do so with 10 hours of coaching and meditation total. This is also around the same duration as my in-person workshops, which are 8 hours long.

One to two sessions a week is my scheduling recommendation. It is not necessary to meditate on your own or every day to see results — I personally do not have a daily meditation habit and only do so when I feel it is an auspicious time — though you may do so.

**The four material jhanas  |  variable**  
I can also teach you on a longer term with asynchronous chatting alongside synchronous calls to help you to access all of the four material jhanas, or to be able to achieve the jhanas more easily or deterministically. Given the many individual factors that go into this, you should book an intro call with me to discuss estimates of time and cost.

# Terms and conditions

Sessions are prepaid. I accept payment with Wise bank transfer, PayPal, and cryptocurrency.

You may reschedule a session that is seven or more days away for free. Past that, you may reschedule a session that is three or more days away for 50% the session price. You cannot reschedule a session past that. No-shows will not be refunded. 

If I have to cancel a session, or if circumstances on my end cut off a session partway, I will give you another session for free — but not if they are on your end.

I do not offer a guarantee. Since jhana is internal, I cannot conclusively and definitively determine whether or not you did access them — though in my experience, there is typically an unmistakable phase change.
