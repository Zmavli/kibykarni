{% epigraph "Be prepared to appreciate what you meet." 'Frank Herbert' 'Dune (1965)' %}

{% marginnote 'apple1' "`mi djica lo plise`" %} Let us consider the English sentence `I want an apple.`

{% marginnote 'apple2' "Respectively, `nu ponse lo plise`, `nu catlu lo plise`, and `nu citka lo plise`" %} If you think about it, it is totally nonsensical. Why? Well, you cannot desire objects. You can only really desire events. When you say `I want an apple.` you are really saying that you want an event *related to* or *concerning* the apple. Perhaps you want to own the apple, or look at the apple, or eat the apple. To translate the vagueness of English `I want an apple.` into Lojban while not assuming any further information, we might say something like `djica lo nu lo plise cu co'e` {% sidenote 'cohe' "`zo'e` is to `co'e` what `da` is to `broda`. It's an elliptical selbri."%}.

To shorten this, Lojban has `tu'a`. It's an abbreviation.

{% marginnote 'suhu' "`su'u` is the most general member of selma'o `NU` and can represent any of them."%}

> `tu'a X == lo su'u X co'e`  
> `where X is a sumti`

Our new and improved sentence is `djica tu'a lo plise`.

### What's this `jai` I keep hearing everywhere?

`jai` is weird. `jai` attaches to selbri rather than sumti. It causes the first place of the selbri to be wrapped in an abstraction.

> `jai broda == tu'a zo'e broda == lo su'u zo'e co'e cu broda`

It is often used in lieu of `tu'a`. Since members of selma'o `LE` extract the x1 place of selbri, by turning the x1 place of the enclosed selbri into an abstraction, `jai` achieves the same effect as `tu'a`. 

> `lo jai broda == tu'a lo broda`
