{% epigraph "A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows." 'Frank Herbert' 'Dune (1965)' %}

{% newthought 'It is with great pleasure' %} that I, Zmavli Caimle, announce the opening of my blog on the year of our Lord, two thousand and twenty-one, on the fifteenth of August.

Wish it all the best.

{% epigraph "Every parent of a teenager gets used to it: the moment in a child's life when he or she decides that certain facts are just too much trouble to explain to Mom or Dad. The parents can't, and needn't, know every last little thing. They just have to accept this, be content with what they can glean on their own, and move on." 'Neal Stephenson' 'Seveneves (2015)' %}
